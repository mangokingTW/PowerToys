"""Recording support for the reproduction.

A reproduction a maintainer has to take on trust is worth much less than one
they can watch. The video is not the evidence — the assertions are — but it
answers a different question: *does this look like the bug I was told about?*

**The recorder is started by the test, not at session start.** An autouse
session fixture begins recording before anything exists, so the first two thirds
of the file are the runner's own console and an application still launching.
Here the `observed` fixture calls `recording.begin()` once the palette is up,
which is the first frame worth keeping.

Command Palette is a fixed-size popup, so unlike the other reproductions in this
series there is nothing to maximise; the recorder captures the screen.

Off unless `WINTEGRATE_RECORD=1`, because it costs a capture thread. Needs the
video extra::

    pip install "wintegrate[video]"
